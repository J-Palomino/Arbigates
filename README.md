# Gates

**User verification using decentralised identity and custom conditions**

Gates is a web3 tool that makes it easy to create custom condtioned gates for your dapp, metaverse, or NFT project.

- âœ¨ Straight-forward API to check user access without violating privacy
- â›© Easily customizable conditions
- ðŸ«¡ Built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [wagmi](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi)

## About

Gates expands the concept of access management by combining on- and off-chain identities, arbitrary conditions, and increased customisability. Managing user access and creating personalised experiences has never been easier.

To protect usersâ€™ data, weâ€™re utilising DID (decentralised identities) for Ceramic where only the user own and can modify their (encrypted) data. Enjoy!

## Quick start

To run an example locally, install dependencies.

```bash
yarn install
```

Then go into the `web` directory.

```bash
cd web
```

Then run the dev script.

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `smart-contracts`: smart contracts with hardhat
- `web3-config`: deployments, generated types from contract and common web3 config
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
