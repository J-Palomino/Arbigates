# Gates

**User verification using decentralised identity and custom conditions**

Gates is a web3 tool that makes it easy to create custom condtioned gates for your dapp, metaverse, or NFT project.

- âœ¨ Straight-forward API to check user access without violating privacy
- â›© Easily customizable conditions
- ðŸ«¡ Built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [wagmi](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi)

## About

Gates expands the concept of access management by combining on- and off-chain identities, arbitrary conditions, and increased customisability. Managing user access and creating personalised experiences has never been easier.

To protect usersâ€™ data, weâ€™re utilising DID (decentralised identities) for Ceramic where only the user own and can modify their (encrypted) data. Enjoy!

```bash
yarn install
```
